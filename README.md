<b>Kids Connect</b>

<b>KidConnect</b> will be the way to <b>build a deeper connection</b> between parents/guardians with their kids in this difficult time. Learning <b>how educators convey ideas to children</b> is an important lesson for all parents/guardians.

This platform will also hopefully help Artists and Educators <b>find a way to help children</b> in a more flexible and interesting way. A <b>forum</b> can also be implemented so <b>parents can share ideas</b> of what they would like to see. Content creators then can find <b>who else is also interested in a specific topic, and reach out to collaborate.</b>
